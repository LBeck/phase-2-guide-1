# Nodes by Beni

* A node is an element in the DOM tree.
* The DOM tree is all the HTML elements ordered by parents and trees. 
* The tree head is `<DOCTYPE>` then  `<html>` 
* Other nodes are `<head>`, `<body>`

* Need to know where parents are to understand tree structure and be able to access them.
