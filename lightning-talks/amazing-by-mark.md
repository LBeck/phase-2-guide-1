## What just happened?
I put my hand in the air and you paid attention and I said you were awesome. 

* Cue: The thing that triggers you. (I put my hand up)
* Routine : The thing you do from the cue. (You paid attention)
* Reward: What you should get when you do the routine. (I said you were awesome)

* A Habit is the cycle of Cue-Routine-Reward.

* You can change a habit by first recognizing the cue, find a NEW routine, and make sure you get a reward. REPEAT.

* Morning alarms are a great cue.
