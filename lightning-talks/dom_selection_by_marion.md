# Dom Selection

* A code kata - do it in jQuery and JS

* `$('.a')` - select anything with a class of `a`

* String them together to select a child from inside a parent. `$(h2 .c)` - use a **space** to select all elements with a class of `c` within an `h2` element. 

* `$('.d.c')` - use **no space** to select elements with both classes `d` and `c`

* The *comma* allows both elements selected.
