# My new friends

* When I learned HTML on Monday I had to write each new HTML page with a lot of repeated tags.

* Using a layout.erb page allows me to refactor all this into a single file.  If you add a `<% yeild %> ` tag then you can put your individual pages into the yield block.

* If I want to just add a small change then you can use a partial. 

* My friends are layout, yield, and partials.
