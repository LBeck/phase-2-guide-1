# Soylent

* Word on the street is there is the "really old" movie called **Soylent Green** - where the Utopian society is all about eating people.

* What do you spend money on?  The top 3-5 for most people is food.

* Some engineer made the product **Soylent** which is the (non-people) super food powder, so we no longer have to bother with finding and eating food. 

* Crowd funded. Coming soon to you.
