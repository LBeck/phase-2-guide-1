# High Frequency Trading

* What do these people have in common (Warren Buffet, Jamie Dinon, Lloyd Blankfein)
  * They all have A LOT of money
* Trading that happens VERY quickly - run by computers.

```
BUY : $1.00    SELL : $1.01
```

* In high frequency trading you switch between buy/sell with HIGH frequency. 

* Can think of as two queues a buying queue and a selling queue.  Buy orders are flooded onto the buying queue until a buy happens and then the selling queue engages until a sell.  The quantity ensures a lot of buys and sells throughout the day.
