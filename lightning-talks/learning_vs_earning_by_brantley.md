##Learning vs Earning

### Options Post DBC
* Large Company
* Small Company
* Start a Startup
* Other

### Money?
* Offered 2.25% (this is WAY more than a normal offer of .06%) of a company that exits for $50 million.
* + $31.25k per year but after taxes this is like $18k
* Don't really make  a "TON OF MONEY"
* Startup stock usually vests over 4 years so an early exit is not always a good deal. 

### Start Your Own
* Work on passion
