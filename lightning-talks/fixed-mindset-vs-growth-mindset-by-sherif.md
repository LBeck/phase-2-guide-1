# Fixed Mindset vs Growth Mindset

* Work by Carol Dwep on how students learn.  Found groups would cluster into two groups based on how they reacted to confusion.

* These groupings are not set in stone - they can vary based on how you are feeling (tired, hungry, etc.)

* People who are more likely to go into the Fixed Mindset were influenced growing up by being told "you're smart" by others and associating your self worth with performance.

* People who are likely to go into the Growth Mindset were influence growing up by being told by someone how interesting your learning is.

* In the Fixed Mindset you feel like challenges are too hard, not worth doing, you're bored, tired, (ie not learning)

* In the Growth Mindset you are challenged, excited and keep pushing to learn.
