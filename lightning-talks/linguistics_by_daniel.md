## Linguistic Relativity

* Whatever language you think in affects the way that you see the world.
  * Ex: in Japanese they see blue and green as the same color so when discussing things that are blue and/or green they don't distinguish the events.

* The language you are using changes the way you conceptualize your world.

* In code - we learn LOTS of new terms - how can we conceptualize them? 
  * Careful, aware use of terminology helps to clarify concepts. 
* Code switching - fluent switch between languages - given the choice one language is used for a particular topic (Russian for home life, English for work life).
