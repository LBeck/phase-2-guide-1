# A story 

* Everyone can benefit from being more entrepreneurial.  If you see a problem think of how you can solve it. 

* Ex: User can't get into the garage at girlfriends house because I need her to buzz me in.  Build a twilio app that intercepts a txt from user and produces a buzz for validated users.

* We now have the tech to build something like this.
