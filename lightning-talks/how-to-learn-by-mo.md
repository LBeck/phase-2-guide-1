#How to learn

* `puts` EVERYTHING.
  * Don't just `puts` variables, but use other attributes like `myperson.class` and `Person.methods` or  `Person.methods - Object.methods` to just get the methods for the particular object and not the inherited ones. 
* You can get more information by using both `puts` and `p`.  
* Be smart on searching for keywords when exploring a gem.
