# The Importance of Smiling

* The act of smiling activates muscles and triggers a feedback loop in your brain that releases endorphins that make you feel better and reduce stress.
* Smiling makes you look better. 
* Smiles are contagious. 
* Even when life sucks (like it can at DBC) and you feel terrible, smiling still helps. 
* You always have your face with you so you can always smile!
* People are good at detecting if your smile is genuine or false. 

* "The smile is a curve that sets everything straight" - Phylis Diller
