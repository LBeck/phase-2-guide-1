# Cool Web Sites (jQuery Animate)

* Animate is a great jQuery method to make your pages look cool.

* This code will animate to the given values of `opacity` and `color` from the current values.

``` $('#something').animate({opacity: 1, color:red} 1000)
```

* Need to have `position:absolute` or `position:relative` set on an element in order to animate it's position on the page. 

* `setTimeout(some_function, 100)` allows you to run animations one after another. **OR** use the callbacks available to `animate()`.

* To animate keyframes you need to put them in their own class.
