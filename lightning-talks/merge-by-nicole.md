##Merge Conflicts

* When you get a merge conflict - open the file with conflict and look for the markers: 
`<<<<<<<< HEAD ` , `======== `and `>>>>>>>>>test`

* Remove the markers and whichever code you don't want to keep. 

* Save the changes and re-commit. 

* You might also decide to just keep one file without changes. 

* In any case just make sure the markers are deleted.
