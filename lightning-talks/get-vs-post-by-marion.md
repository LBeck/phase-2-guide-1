# Get vs Post

(pretty picture missing from notes)

* We communicate with the server from our browsers using http request and response

* Get should be used to get information (READ)

* Post should be used to send information to the server (CREATE)

* These http protocal verbs are mapped to the `get` and `post` methods (routes) in sinatra.

* In a get you pass parameters through the url. You can bookmark a get request. 

* In a post the params are accessible from within the post method itself.
