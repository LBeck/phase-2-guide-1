## Aha

* A story : As an exchange students in Germany with a large group I was asked to leave the group for 20 minutes and then come back.
* When I came back they gave me a box of stuff (tape, string, etc. ) and said:  
  * "Use this stuff to retrieve a watter bottle while not leaving the chair" in 3 minutes
  * Didn't figure it out.  
* Next student came in and just asked another student to give it to her.
