# Founders By Daniel

* What do these 5 names (David Karp, Sergey Brin, Jack Derey, Elen Musk and The Zuck) have in common? 

  * They are all billionaires.
  * They all work (WORK) every day.  They aren't driven to make money, they are driven by the work and the joy of solving problems.
  * My point: money doesn't mean much.

* When you get a job, especially in a tech startup be aware of your motivations and the motivations of your company.  
  * Work with people who are driven!

* Constantly ask yourself "Why am I doing"

* RSA Drive - Dan Pink - movie.
* Founders at Work - book.
