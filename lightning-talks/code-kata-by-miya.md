# Code Kata

* Kata is Japanese which means: detailed choreographed movement repeated over and over.

* Dave Thomas introduced the concept of Kata applied to coding : solve the same coding problem over and over with different approaches. 

* Needs to be done in a small amount of un-interrupted time.

* Works well for some who learn by repetition.

* Let's your internalize the smaller movements so they are second nature and the bigger movements become just a series of smaller movements.
