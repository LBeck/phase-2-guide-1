# User Interface Design (UID)

* What is your value proposition? What are you providing? What problem are you solving?

* Website in Two Pages - Home Pages and Landing Pages 
* **Landing Page** - single page optimized for display ads - would just target google users or other uninformed users that have clicked on an ad to get to your site.
* **Home Page** - usually for users who already know about your product. Usually 1/2 information, 1/2 getting a sign up (call to action).

* When someone visits your page, you usually have a few seconds to make an impression.  Users scan a page from top to bottom (in an F shape - Most important info at TOP LEFT)

* Don't use red. Psychologically linked with "bad", "danger"
