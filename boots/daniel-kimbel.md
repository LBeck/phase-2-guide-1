I learned some awesome Sinatra tricks today -- how to use a form to send a delete request, and (more importantly) how to use layout.erb to get global headers and footers onto your web app.

I learned a decent amount about using Sinatra today, and got the opportunity to learn more about RSpec. I still feel extremely weak in the latter, though.
