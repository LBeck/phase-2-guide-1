I fooled around in Rspec today and had some issues. A couple of refactors and everything became broken.
I worked some more in a ruby webapp and felt very good about the work I did. It solidified a lot of concepts
I have been working with. I feel confident with post and get routes.

I need to work on my testing. I feel comfortable with DOM manipulation using javascript and jquery. I understand ajax purpose very well and when to apply it. I could use work in debugging javascript and general design principles in javascript.
