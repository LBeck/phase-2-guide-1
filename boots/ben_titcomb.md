Today was very fun.  While there was a lot of frustration, I'm surprised that I now know some of the basics in writing for another language.  My knowledge of Ruby has transferred over reasonably well to Javascript.

I spent most of the day getting to know rspec, which we used to write tests for our social network.  I also used Capybara to emulate user input on a page.
