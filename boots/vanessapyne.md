I guess I wouldn't give myself any thumbs up for anything today.  maybe if heroku was on here, one for that.  
and one for git.  learned about remotes and ssh keys.  off topic but still important I think.  speaking of off topic 
id like to publicly rededicate myself to kindness.  it's one of the three things dbc is about- kindness, integrity, 
and... a third thing.  anyway, I feel like with all the stress of phase two, remembering to be kind is something I've 
been forgetting.

so iactually looked at the lists today to calculate thumbs up.  doing this on my iPad so formatting = screwy.  
Dan did a great breakout on HTML/CSS so I feel like I have a good overview of it and look forward to seeing it again 
on Friday.  I feel like ruby web apps is where I need to dedicate my time tmrw.  testing is also a weakness.

so i'm actually going to submit a pull request tonight for this so that'll be good... i guess my thumbs up haven't changed
much..  i feel very unsure of rspec and TDD... i've been hung up on environments and dependencies.  they derail one so
quickly, i'd like to know as much about them as possible as to cut down on troubleshooting time.  i think i'm going to pull
up the challenge from today and do what i can of it again tonight.
