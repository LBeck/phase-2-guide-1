I guess I wouldn't give myself any thumbs up for anything today.  maybe if heroku was on here, one for that.  and one for git.  learned about remotes and ssh keys.  off topic but still important I think.  speaking of off topic id like to publicly rededicate myself to kindness.  it's one of the three things dbc is about- kindness, integrity, and... a third thing.  anyway, I feel like with all the stress of phase two, remembering to be kind is something I've been forgetting.
