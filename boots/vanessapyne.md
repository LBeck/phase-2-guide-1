I guess I wouldn't give myself any thumbs up for anything today.  maybe if heroku was on here, one for that.  and one for git.  learned about remotes and ssh keys.  off topic but still important I think.  speaking of off topic id like to publicly rededicate myself to kindness.  it's one of the three things dbc is about- kindness, integrity, and... a third thing.  anyway, I feel like with all the stress of phase two, remembering to be kind is something I've been forgetting.

so iactually looked at the lists today to calculate thumbs up.  doing this on my iPad so formatting = screwy.  Dan did a great breakout on HTML/CSS so I feel like I have a good overview of it and look forward to seeing it again on Friday.  I feel like ruby web apps is where I need to dedicate my time tmrw.  testing is also a weakness.
