30 October

Today: Practised TDD but got really way-laid by a strange bug. Found the morning a bit unsatisfying because of that.
Sweet sweet yoga, for the first time since Thursday. Continued team project. Played around with routes. Team achieved goal for the day, which was nice. Concerned about a team member. They are anxious about falling behind, when I feel like they are doing fine. I'm concerned because their anxiety might get in the way of their learning.
