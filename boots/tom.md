30 October

Today: Practised TDD but got really way-laid by a strange bug. Found the morning a bit unsatisfying because of that.
Sweet sweet yoga, for the first time since Thursday. Continued team project. Played around with routes. Team achieved goal for the day, which was nice. Concerned about a team member. They are anxious about falling behind, when I feel like they are doing fine. I'm concerned because their anxiety might get in the way of their learning.
HTML/CSS session with Dan. Very good.

31 October

Today: Worked on forms and users with Bennie. Struggled a bit to hold all the pieces in my head at the same time, considering you have to factor in changes and inputs in both the controller (routes) and the view (views). Changing how I set up my Sublime so I can look at both at the same time.
Afternoon session on users, sessions and authentication was really good. Helped a lot.

Member of group project had a huge super ego attack and helped them with that. They then went on a coding drive and finished a slew of group tasks by themself. Harnessing their potential and meshing it with the rest of the group become my implicit task for the rest of the week.

Listened to Myles talk on Data shapes and the joys of encoding.

Did a bit more on Forms with Bennie.

Today: HTML CSS in the morning. Good progress with Tyler. Learnt about display: inline.
Group project in afternoon had a bunch of double-work and some poor coordination. However, worked closely with my pair and had a good session with them.
Reflecting on my skill self-assessment, certainly need to focus on TDD exercises and challenges for my weekend revision.

Wednesday
Half way through Dev Bootcamp. From JS perspective, good pairing session in the morning. Got to write out a bunch of JS. Felt really productive because I made a bunch of syntax errors and was corrected, so nice tight feedback loop. Got to play with more and more testing code, comfortable with dealing with the tests that others have written. Need to write more on my own. JQuery exercise was a bit rushed, need to get back to that. Evening learning filled with more JS, and JQuery as possibly.

Tuesday
First day on JS. Good morning session. Had fun building something that was almost a orangeTree constructor. Good to have my assumptions about where to place functions that belong to a constructor (outside of them, not inside like we did). Group project is struggling for momentum.

Monday
Recap day. Very welcome chance to just focus on the prior weeks of learning. Still have a few topics to dive back into in the future.

The Weekend
JS, JS, JS, Sinatra, JS. I'm more and more disatisfied by TeamTreeHouse. Sinatra labs were good but found the linked exercises frustrating, due to lack of feedback about errors. Perhaps an enduring facet of working with JS...

It took 21 minutes to review and assess the above ten criteria

November 11
Slower progress today. Tried to do one of the exercises without AJAX....when you really should just use AJAX. After some muppeting around, I returned to the AJAX implementation.

November 9/10 (Weekend)
Reviewed material about APIs and had a brief investigation into some of the more common APIs available. Read up a bit on OAuth and OmniAuth. Finished two portfolio challenges and another older portfolio challenge. Got my laptop to boot for the first time in 10 days.

November 8
Enjoyed working through Survey Fun in the morning. Group project in the afternoon continued to be slow paced. Spent learning optimisation time on Group Project and then went out for the evening.

November 7
Struggled with AJAX Todos in the morning. Understood the flow and concept of AJAX from the lecture, but continuely struggled with syntax, formatting and structure of the actual code. Had a good, if drawn-out, session in evening with one of the coaches that helped sort that out. Group project in the afternoon. I finally get around to suggesting that we sort out user stories. Found the cohort reactions to not voting on the Phase 3 pitches to be fascinating. Seemed like a typical group-expectation dissonance, and while you can't take that back, felt like there are sensible solutions to avoid it in the future.

Finished entries 39 minutes after start. Anticipating another minute will be used gitting.
