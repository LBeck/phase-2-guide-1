30 October

Today: Practised TDD but got really way-laid by a strange bug. Found the morning a bit unsatisfying because of that.
Sweet sweet yoga, for the first time since Thursday. Continued team project. Played around with routes. Team achieved goal for the day, which was nice. Concerned about a team member. They are anxious about falling behind, when I feel like they are doing fine. I'm concerned because their anxiety might get in the way of their learning.
HTML/CSS session with Dan. Very good.

31 October

Today: Worked on forms and users with Bennie. Struggled a bit to hold all the pieces in my head at the same time, considering you have to factor in changes and inputs in both the controller (routes) and the view (views). Changing how I set up my Sublime so I can look at both at the same time.
Afternoon session on users, sessions and authentication was really good. Helped a lot.

Member of group project had a huge super ego attack and helped them with that. They then went on a coding drive and finished a slew of group tasks by themself. Harnessing their potential and meshing it with the rest of the group become my implicit task for the rest of the week.

Listened to Myles talk on Data shapes and the joys of encoding.

Did a bit more on Forms with Bennie.

01 November

Today: HTML CSS in the morning. Good progress with Tyler. Learnt about display: inline. 
Group project in afternoon had a bunch of double-work and some poor coordination. However, worked closely with my pair and had a good session with them.
Reflecting on my skill self-assessment, certainly need to focus on TDD exercises and challenges for my weekend revision.
