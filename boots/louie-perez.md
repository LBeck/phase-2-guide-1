[Objective] Thumbs-up(Displayed as +)

Coders Mindset +
I need to work on testing more before I feel comfortable putting another mark on this.

Testing and TDD +
Same as above I need to become more comfortable with the other testing suites.  I am able to navigate Jasmine fairly well.

Debugging ++
When tests are provided I can usually navigate my way through errors and find the route cause of the problem.  I was able to hypothesize that the reason why the music was not playing in SLJracer was because it was not being loaded completely before the CSS loaded.  I proved it by using the debugger to show that they were out of sync.

Ruby Webapps +
I can create my own sinatra skeleton with some difficulty and I am able to use restful routes.  I need references to use AJAX effectively and I have not even used Socket.

Active Record ++
While I still make syntax errors (validates vs validate) I am able to perform most if not all the learning objectives listed.

HTML and CSS ++
I am able to build a frame with HTML and populate and style it with CSS and JS respectively.  While I do not know all the selectors available to me I do know what is possible and am able to adjust accordingly.

Javascript The Language ++
I am able to create prototypes easily, what I struggle with is scope and the availability of variables at different levels.  There seems to be 5 different ways to write a function and each allows for some "var invasion" if you are not careful.  I do default to JQuery more often than not though.

Testing Javascript +
I am able to use Jasmine to test fairly well.  Capybara still eludes me.

Debugging Javascript ++
I love debugger.  Though I still need to use Jasmine and Capy to test. Right now I am using console.log() to see that I am getting what I expect to.

Javascript for Web Applications +
AJAX is a weak point for me, while I understand the concept and can implement it I usually need a cheatsheet to do what I want.
