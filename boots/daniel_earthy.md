I feel confident in approaching new problems, looking at old code examples and reconciling the two as
I take what I need to build what I'm trying to.  I could do more work on TDD and testing frameworks
but I'm enjoying too much learning about Sinatra and trying new things to stop and dive deeper
into testing frameworks.  I also feel that learning how to test Sinatra before I have a marginal understanding of it will teach me neither Sinatra nor testing well.
