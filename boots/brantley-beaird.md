I would love to have 2 or 3 thumbs competency for these different areas, but I feel like it's a tall order.  Hopefully I feel a bit behind but am okay with that as it just takes a bit more time and repetition for me to get these things down.  I feel 3x better than I did in phase 2 the first time.  I also feel like the Fox Squirrels as a whole are really on top of their game.  

For Coder's Mindset I think I do okay - I think this is one of the reasons it takes me longer to write code (i.e. I'm thinking things out more...for better or for worse...sometimes it's good (for me) to just dive in.  

I haven't done any testing outside of our daily exercises. It is very useful to see tests and try to make them past. It's tough to start making tests from scratch, not knowing the syntax and different things we can test.  Capybara testing seems to be the most intuitive.  I often rack my brain for edge cases as it's interesting to me. Having manually tested a bunch of things, it's now easy to see the value of testing...particularly end to end testing like Capybara - typing shit in forms is annoying, especially with uniqueness validations.   

Topher has gotten me in the habit of really looking at error messages. I also continue to practice googling errors and am getting more comfortable with the right places to find answers (StackOverflow, documentation). I do try to thoroughly hypothesize various solutions, but I also find it useful to "see what happens" if I change ONE thing. I never use the debugger...but prolly should.  I should get better about creating branches for tests to throw away. 

I get the ideas behind the Ruby webapps we've done but have not had a chance to personally implement all the items (e.g. bcrypt, I sort of did sessions on the group project). I still don't completely understand what makes a route RESTful...it seems like it's just a naming convention. I know I've mentioned this before, but I feel like I learn well when I have solid examples to go off of...probably all that formal schooling. Additionally, since there are SO many things out there, sometimes I'm not aware of the appropriate solution. Perhaps it wasn't taught or referenced and we were supposed to come up with / come across the answer ourselves, perhaps it was covered and I just didn't get it. This is where I should ask for help (more often). Too often I feel like I don't ask for help early enough - this is partially because I want to have some time to at least try to figure it out myself, since most of our work is pairing (which I enjoy).  

HTML and CSS used to be like Chinese, but now it's more like Spanish, so that's a plus. It really helped / helps to think of HTML as structure only. When I saw various big name sites without CSS, things started to make a lot more sense...HTML is just the structure.  Granted things have become a big more complicated with embedded Ruby and jQuery. I have done very little CSS but am confident that I can make a page look presentable. It will be a while though before I can do any Dan Bender stuff, heh!

ActiveRecord...


Week 2
Coder's Mindset :+1::+1:
JS the Language :+1:
Testing JS :+1:
Debugging JS :+1:
JS for Web Apps :+1:

More coming later...
Just need to practice JS more. Haven't done anything other than morning exercises with JS testing. The connections between HTML, Ruby, and JS is still solidifying, slowly but surely ;0)
