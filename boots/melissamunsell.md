Phase 2 Week 3 - I have at minimum a basic knowledge of the following from Phase 2, Week 2 Learning Objectives:

/////////////////
CODER'S MINDSET//
////////////////
I review and merge other peoples code
I can explain why I wrote each line of code
I can explain the difference between abstraction and indirection
I can find and use gems to solve problems
I proactively organize my code
I follow my programming languages formatting standards

I keep my code small
I explain new things I've learned to my pair and team
I know which abstraction layer I'm currently working in
My team members can navigate the code I write

I am regularly asked to explain new things I've learned to others
I know why each line of code in my project exists and can explain them on demand

/////////////////////////
JAVASCRIPT THE LANGUAGE//
/////////////////////////
I can define variables that contain Strings, Numbers, Functions and Objects
I am comfortable passing functions as arguments to other functions
I declare variables with the var keyword to prevent them from being defined at the global scope
I reference the documentation for javascript frequently
I always use === for equality tests and I understand why this won't test value equality for arrays and objects
I understand that every function creates a new scope for variable names

I write functions which take functions as an argument
I use the module pattern to keep my functions and variables out of the global scope
I can accurately trace what this will be in most instances

/////////////////////
TESTING JAVASCRIPT//
////////////////////
I can use Capybara to test javascript that interacts with the DOM and server
I can use capybara to test drive javascript that interacts with the DOM and server

//////////////////////
DEBUGGING JAVASCRIPT//
//////////////////////
I use the console to write small snippets of code to validate my assumptions
I use console.log to investigate the javascript applications state
I am ~50% accurate when guessing if an error is on the server or the client side
I sometimes reference the Mozilla Developer Network's documentation

I use the debugger command to investigate bugs in my javascript
I can find and use official documentation for the javascript libraries I'm using
I regularly navigate the official documentation for JavaScript using the Mozilla Developers Network

I easily navigate the Mozilla Developers Network javascript documentation

/////////////////////////////////
JavaScript for Web Applications//
/////////////////////////////////
I can use jQuery to retrieve elements from the DOM using CSS selectors
I can use jQuery's traversal methods to find elements relative to the given element
I can bind my code to events triggered on elements I've pulled from the DOM
I can trigger my own events on elements I've pulled from the DOM
I can use jQuery to modify the tree structure of DOM

I can use addEventListener to bind events without jQuery
I use jQuery to implement event delegation

I separate my view concerns from my data retrieval and storage concerns
I use AJAX to retrieve JSON encoded data from the server and then modify the page based on that data

Phase 2 Week 1

Coders Mindset

I can explain why I wrote each line of code
I can find and use gems to solve problems
I proactively organize my code
I follow my programming languages formatting standards

Testing & TDD	

I sometimes follow TDD's Red Green Refactor
My tests have a single expectation

Debugging	

I read error messages, and can find where in my code the error was raised
I create hypothesis about why the code is broken before I try to fix it.
I have a structured approach to proving my hypothesis'
I can identify the boundaries between abstraction layers when debugging

Ruby Webapps	

I've handled form input with post routes

ActiveRecord	

I've created migrations and models
I've used sinatra-activrecord to integrate activerecord and sinatra
I've defined belongs_to and has_many relationships
I've written validations for presence and uniqueness
I can easily use where and find to retrieve data

HTML & CSS

I can clearly explain the two different roles that HTML and CSS play
I use semantic markup to separate my visual presentation from my document structure
I've added a stylesheet to a web page
