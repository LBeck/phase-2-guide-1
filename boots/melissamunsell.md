Coders Mindset

I can explain why I wrote each line of code
I can find and use gems to solve problems
I proactively organize my code
I follow my programming languages formatting standards

Testing & TDD	

I sometimes follow TDD's Red Green Refactor
My tests have a single expectation

Debugging	

I read error messages, and can find where in my code the error was raised
I create hypothesis about why the code is broken before I try to fix it.
I have a structured approach to proving my hypothesis'
I can identify the boundaries between abstraction layers when debugging

Ruby Webapps	

I've handled form input with post routes

ActiveRecord	

I've created migrations and models
I've used sinatra-activrecord to integrate activerecord and sinatra
I've defined belongs_to and has_many relationships
I've written validations for presence and uniqueness
I can easily use where and find to retrieve data

HTML & CSS

I can clearly explain the two different roles that HTML and CSS play
I use semantic markup to separate my visual presentation from my document structure
I've added a stylesheet to a web page
