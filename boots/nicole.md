Sorry, the fractions may be a little off. Few changes from yesterday, but I have managed to write my own Rspec tests, which is tons of fun. Note that I actually know a bit of HTML and CSS, which is why it's as high as this. I'll still need to work on some stuff, and also work on my group dynamic.

Today, I learned quite a bit more about sessions. I had looked into them last night, but they're incredibly simple. I was also better able to write custom error messages, though I can't seem to implement them well quite yet. However, I found that my emotional mindset is off, considering I was extremely
offended when the strongest members of our groups broke off. My group thought it was a trick question, so we hadn't 
seriously debated it.
