Aha! The BCrypt password method replaces the active record attribute password in code which is used to compare the
password entered in params to the password stored in a user database. Like this:
if ( user.password == params[:user][:password] ) ... a true value means the password was right and we can log them in
where user is an active record table entry, ie a row in the table, which Sinatra AR returns as an object

However sometimes it feels like whack-a-mole in that I learn some things and learn more of my ignorance in others.

Yikes!! Thought I was understanding better than this. I want to focus on developing and being able to communicate 
hypothesis clearly, and being able to consienciously move between layers of abstraction.
