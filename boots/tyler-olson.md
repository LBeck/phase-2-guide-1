<h2>Phase 2 Week 1 Learning Objectives To Do/Learn:</h2>

<h3>Coders Mindset</h3>
<p>https://github.com/fox-squirrels-2013/phase-2-guide/blob/master/week-1/learning-objectives/coders-mindset.md</p>

<ul>
	<li>Review and merge other peoples code</li>
	<li>Learn the difference between abstraction and indirection</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Follow the 4 rules of simple design</li>
	<li>Find a strategy for choosing when to go through an abstraction layer</li> 
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Provide sample code in pull request comments that aligns with the 4 rules of simple design</li>
	<li>Read the source code for gems when I evaluate them for use</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing and TDD</h3>
<p>https://github.com/fox-squirrels-2013/phase-2-guide/blob/master/week-1/learning-objectives/testing-and-tdd.md</p>

<ul>
	<li>I follow BetterSpec's guide on how to describe methods</li>
	<li>I am familiar with test doubles and can use stubs.</li>
	<li>I'm familiar with the Agile Testing Quadrants</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>I test several possible outcomes for a given method</li>
	<li>I extract modules to share functionality between multiple spec files</li>
	<li>I use let for test setup</li>
	<li>I use subject with contexts to dry up my tests</li>
	<li>I use rspec and capybara to test from the users perspective</li>
	<li>I regularly use stubs as stand ins for collaborators</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>I use continuous integration to run all tests on every push</li>
	<li>I'm aware of the differences between spies, stubs, fakes and mocks and use them each appropriately</li>
</ul>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p>https://github.com/fox-squirrels-2013/phase-2-guide/blob/master/week-1/learning-objectives/debugging.md</p>

I read error messages, and can find where in my code the error was raised
I create hypothesis about why the code is broken before I try to fix it.
I have a structured approach to proving my hypothesis'
I have a structured approach to managing my time when debugging
I can identify the boundaries between abstraction layers when debugging
I triangulate when debugging
I use the chrome console to inspect elements and network traffic.
I can use the ruby debugger to inspect program state
:+1::+1:

I create several hypothesis' about problems before trying to fix it
I can leverage the boundaries between abstraction layers when debugging
I can use rspec to test my hypothesis
I actively look for ways to speed up my feedback loop
I context switch between big picture/little picture when debugging
When I ask for help I clearly describe the problem I'm trying to solve
I can step through code in the ruby debugger
My judgement sometimes keeps me from going down rabbit holes
:+1::+1::+1:

I create and throw away branches for each hypothesis as I debug
My judgement frequently keeps me from going down rabbit holes
I quickly find the place in my code where errors are raised
I almost solely rely on rspec framework when debugging
