<p>https://github.com/fox-squirrels-2013/phase-2-guide/blob/master/week-1/learning-objectives/coders-mindset.md</p>

<ul>
	<li>Review and merge other peoples code</li>
	<li>Learn the difference between abstraction and indirection</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Follow the 4 rules of simple design</li>
	<li>Find a strategy for choosing when to go through an abstraction layer</li> 
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Provide sample code in pull request comments that aligns with the 4 rules of simple design</li>
	<li>Read the source code for gems when I evaluate them for use</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing and TDD</h3>
<p>https://github.com/fox-squirrels-2013/phase-2-guide/blob/master/week-1/learning-objectives/testing-and-tdd.md</p>

<ul>
	<li>I follow BetterSpec's guide on how to describe methods</li>
	<li>I am familiar with test doubles and can use stubs.</li>
	<li>I'm familiar with the Agile Testing Quadrants</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>I test several possible outcomes for a given method</li>
	<li>I extract modules to share functionality between multiple spec files</li>
	<li>I use let for test setup</li>
	<li>I use subject with contexts to dry up my tests</li>
	<li>I use rspec and capybara to test from the users perspective</li>
	<li>I regularly use stubs as stand ins for collaborators</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>I use continuous integration to run all tests on every push</li>
	<li>I'm aware of the differences between spies, stubs, fakes and mocks and use them each appropriately</li>
</ul>

<p>https://github.com/fox-squirrels-2013/phase-2-guide/blob/master/week-1/learning-objectives/debugging.md</p>

<ul>
	<li>I can identify the boundaries between abstraction layers when debugging</li>
	<li>I triangulate when debugging</li>
	<li>I use the chrome console to inspect elements and network traffic.</li>
	<li>I can use the ruby debugger to inspect program state</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>I can leverage the boundaries between abstraction layers when debugging</li>
	<li>I can use rspec to test my hypothesis</li>
	<li>I can step through code in the ruby debugger</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>I almost solely rely on rspec framework when debugging</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>I can explain the different parts of a URI</li>
	<li>I've configured my app to use different databases in test and development</li>
	<li>I've used bcrypt to encrypt passwords to keep them secret even from people who have access to the database.</li>
	<li>I've used partials and passed them local variables</li>
	<li>I've written a program that uses Socket^ to communicate between two computers on a local network</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>I've deployed a rack compliant app to a hosting service other than heroku</li>
	<li>I've written a basic HTTP Server in ruby</li>
</ul>

	<li>I've used callbacks</li>
	<li>I test drive my models with the shoulda-matchers</li>
</ul>

<ul>

	<li>I have used another ORM (i.e. datamapper or sequel)</li>
	<li>I've written a simple ORM from scratch</li>
</ul>

<h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
